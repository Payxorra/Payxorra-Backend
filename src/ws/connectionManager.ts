/**

 *
 * WebSocket Connection Manager — race-condition fix for Issue #3.
 *
 * Problem:
 *   handleDisconnect() was async: it emitted a node_disconnected event to the
 *   event bus (awaiting acknowledgment) BEFORE removing the connection from the
 *   pool. During the 5 ms async gap, handleReconnect() saw the OLD connection
 *   still in the pool, raised DuplicateConnectionError, and rejected the
 *   reconnect. The node then waited 30 s before attempting again.
 *
 * Fix:
 *   1. Pool removal is now SYNCHRONOUS — happens before any async I/O.
 *   2. RECONNECT_GRACE_MS (500 ms) grace window: a rapid reconnect during the
 *      grace window is accepted and matched to the disconnecting slot.
 *   3. connectionGen counter: the pool stores the generation per node. A
 *      reconnect with gen > currentGen is accepted even while a disconnect
 *      handler is in-flight. The disconnect handler checks gen before
 *      completing — if gen has advanced, the disconnect is stale and skipped.
 *   4. The disconnect handler synchronously removes the pool entry and
 *      enqueues the event for asynchronous delivery, keeping pool state
 *      always consistent before async operations.
